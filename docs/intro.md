# Blockchain Operating System

Blockchain Operating System (aka BOS), is a blockchain-based platform-as-a-service for decentralized front-ends. BOS aims to revolutionize the way we develop and interact with decentralized apps. We believe BOS will help achieve the goal of making Web 3.0 more accessible to everyone.

BOS is based on three pillars: Gateway, Components, and Blockchains. Gateway provides access points (similar to app stores) to apps. While gateways are often hosted by a third-party, they can also be self-hosted. There could be a few major gateways with search functionality for most apps, while other gateways will be spun up for specific use cases such as Decentralized Finance (DeFI). Components are HTML/CSS/JavaScript code that is stored on-chain and loaded into gateways to be shown to users. BOS is also chain-agnostic, and allows components to target any blockchain for smart contract interactions.

BOS aims to tackle several critical challenges around building front-ends for Web 3.0 apps, including access, security, composability, and agility. With BOS, users always have access to all apps with the assurance that the apps are run in a robust and censorship-resistant manner, while maintaining a user-friendly experience. The code for components is always on-chain, making it auditable and viewable in explorers. This enhances security, and users can run the full stack with confidence. Furthermore, BOS fosters composability by enabling developers to reuse and remix components. Building with BOS is extremely lightweight and easy, with the ability to deploy new front-ends for smart contracts on mainnet in less than 10 minutes. Additionally, BOS is chain-agnostic, making it a flexible solution for developers working with different blockchains.

It's important to note that BOS is still in its early stages. The official unveiling of BOS will take place at the ETH Denver conference, and it will be made available to the public before the end of the Q2 2023. The team behind BOS is hard at work on several initiatives to enhance the platform, including developer tooling such as an in-browser editor, comprehensive documentation and sample projects, and compatibility with more blockchains.

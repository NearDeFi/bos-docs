# FAQ and Gotchas for Near BOS (Blockchain Operating System)

### What is Near BOS?
Near BOS, or Blockchain Operating System, is a revolutionary platform that enables the creation and use of fully decentralized applications across all chains. It provides a platform where users can publish their applications and get discovered by thousands of users, embracing the power of community and web 3 [https://docs.near.org/bos].

### How does Near BOS simplify blockchain interaction?
Near BOS is designed to simplify the complex technical aspects of blockchain, making it more accessible to a wider user base. It offers various tools and components for building applications and interacting with the blockchain. By connecting blockchain applications with "user-friendly pathways," the BOS aims to allow businesses to create and integrate seamless entry points to specific use cases within the blockchain, hiding the underlying complexity from users who experience a simplified interface tailored to the application’s preferences [https://cryptoslate.com/will-near-become-the-blockchain-operating-system-of-web3/].

### What is the role of $NEAR in the BOS ecosystem?
$NEAR serves as the medium of exchange for any licensing or implementations between dApps, widgets, and gateways within the BOS ecosystem. Gateway providers purchase and stake NEAR tokens to cover transaction fees and other user actions that may incur a cost on-chain [https://medium.com/nearprotocol/navigating-the-future-understanding-the-blockchain-operating-system-bos-on-near-5072e25294b5].

### How does Near BOS enhance the user experience?
Near BOS is designed to eventually allow gateways to offer users access to different dApps on different chains, creating a seamless user experience. This means that users can interact with different applications on different blockchains as if they were all part of a unified interface [https://medium.com/nearprotocol/navigating-the-future-understanding-the-blockchain-operating-system-bos-on-near-5072e25294b5].

### Who announced Near BOS and when?
Near BOS is part of the NEAR Protocol project. It was announced by Illia Polosukhin, one of the co-founders of NEAR Protocol, in October 2022 [https://medium.com/nearprotocol/navigating-the-future-understanding-the-blockchain-operating-system-bos-on-near-5072e25294b5].

### What tutorials does Near BOS provide?
Near BOS provides a variety of tutorials to help users get started and make the most of the platform. These tutorials cover topics such as quickstart, contract interaction, multi-chain connection, and application styling [https://docs.near.org/bos].

### What are the gateways for Near BOS?
Near BOS has various gateways like near.org, NEAR Social, bos.gg, and WellDone Gateway. These gateways serve as access points to the BOS [https://docs.near.org/bos].

### What is the mission of Near BOS?
NEAR Protocol, the organization behind Near BOS, is on a mission to onboard a billion users to the infinite possibilities of Web3 with the Blockchain Operating System (BOS) [https://medium.com/nearprotocol/introducing-the-blockchain-operating-system-bos-8004345d02ba].

### What challenges might Near BOS face in terms of ecosystem development?
Near BOS is expected to face challenges in terms of ecosystem development. For BOS to work effectively, it requires a robust base of applications to utilize its features. Currently, like many Alt-L1s, NEAR does not have a shining track record of bringing or keeping builders in their ecosystem. The DeFi scene is immature, NFT liquidity is low, and average volume across NEP-141 tokens remains a pain point. This could potentially hinder the growth and success of BOS [https://medium.com/nearprotocol/navigating-the-future-understanding-the-blockchain-operating-system-bos-on-near-5072e25294b5].

### How does Near BOS balance business and tech aspects?
Near BOS aims to hide the complexity of blockchain technology and offer users frictionless access to blockchain solutions rooted in real-world value creation. However, this approach may face execution challenges. Any open-source system requires evangelization for exponential adoption and success. In a certain scenario, the NEAR Foundation may need to focus more on business development and marketing to ensure the successful adoption of BOS [https://medium.com/nearprotocol/navigating-the-future-understanding-the-blockchain-operating-system-bos-on-near-5072e25294b5].

### What are the potential adoption challenges for Near BOS?
While BOS brings forth a promising future, it’s essential to recognize the potential risks and challenges associated with its implementation. NEAR clearly identified the network effect of Ethereum in its article and the challenges a younger blockchain such as NEAR faces in the face of competition. As the BOS continues to develop, it promises an ever-expanding ecosystem of widgets, dApps, and gateways, but its success will largely depend on its ability to attract and retain users and developers [https://cryptoslate.com/will-near-become-the-blockchain-operating-system-of-web3/].

### How does Near BOS plan to support multiple blockchains?
Communities around BOS are cultivating a universal ecosystem of dApps with connections across networks. Ethereum (and other EVM networks), Cosmos, and Solana will be among the first supported blockchains. However, integrating multiple blockchains into a single platform is a complex task and may present technical challenges [https://medium.com/nearprotocol/introducing-the-blockchain-operating-system-bos-8004345d02ba].
